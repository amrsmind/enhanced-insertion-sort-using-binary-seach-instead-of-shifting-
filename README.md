# enhanced-insertion-sort-using-binary-seach-instead-of-shifting-
using c++ 

Use binary search on the already sorted items to find the place where the
new element should go and then shift the exact number of items that
need to be shifted and placing the new item in its place. The algorithm
works the same, except that instead comparing and shifting item by item,
it will compare quickly using binary search but it will still shift one by one
till the right place (without comparison).
